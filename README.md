## Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a significant role in advancing polymer science and engineering. Considering the critical role of glass transition temperature (Tg) in determining the physical properties of polymers, this study systematically investigates the influence of their composition and sequence structure on Tg using machine learning (ML) models. To clarify the complex relationship between polymer composition and Tg, the k-Nearest Neighbor Mega-Trend Diffusion (kNNMTD) method was employed for data augmentation, and various ML models were constructed for Tg prediction. Among them, the Random Forest model demonstrated the best performance on the generated data, achieving an R² of 0.85 and an RMSE of 0.38. To explore the effect of polymer sequence structure on Tg, we further introduced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to represent polymer sequences. The data was augmented using the Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) model, and Tg predictions were made using a convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) model. This integrated framework achieved excellent predictive performance, with an R² of 0.95 and an RMSE of 0.23, and demonstrated strong generalization across different datasets. In summary, this study introduces an innovative application of kNNMTD for augmenting polymer composition data, combined with NLP techniques for representing polymer sequences. The proposed ML framework offers a valuable contribution to the advancement of polymer material design and optimization.
## Dataset
 SSBR structure and their corresponding Tg values were generated and computed by Molecular Dynamics simulations. SMILES descriptors for the ssbr single-chain were obtained by NovoPro (https://novopro.cn/tools/mol2smiles.html). Example scripts and information necessary to run the examples contained in this article are available at (https://github.com/wawy12/Machine-Learning-Frameworks). CSV files containing MD simulated polymers along with their SMILES and calculated Tg are provided in the Supporting Information. The machine learning models are built with open source python libraries Tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org/) and Scikit-learn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).
