## Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a significant role in advancing polymer science and engineering. Considering the critical role of glass transition temperature (Tg) in determining the physical properties of polymers, this study systematically investigates the influence of their composition and sequence structure on Tg using machine learning models. To elucidate the complex relationship between polymer composition and Tg, the k-Nearest Neighbor Mega-Trend Diffusion (kNNMTD) method was employed for data augmentation, and various machine learning models were developed for Tg prediction. Our results showed that kNNMTD data augmentation significantly improved model performance, with the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model exhibiting superior accuracy in predicting Tg of polymers. To explore the effect of SSBR (Solution Styrene Butadiene Rubber) sequence structure on Tg, we further introduced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to represent polymer sequences. The data was augmented using the Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) model, and Tg predictions were made using a convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) model. The results demonstrated that the hybrid model, integrating NLP, WGAN-GP, and CNN-LSTM, achieved outstanding performance in Tg prediction and exhibited strong generalization across different datasets. In summary, this study presents an innovative application of kNNMTD for augmenting polymer composition data, alongside the utilization of NLP techniques for representing polymer sequences. This novel machine learning approach contributes significantly to the advancement of polymeric material design and optimization.
## Dataset
 SSBR structure and their corresponding Tg values were generated and computed by Molecular Dynamics simulations. SMILES descriptors for the ssbr single-chain were obtained by NovoPro (https://novopro.cn/tools/mol2smiles.html). Example scripts and information necessary to run the examples contained in this article are available at (https://github.com/wawy12/Machine-Learning-Frameworks). CSV files containing MD simulated polymers along with their SMILES and calculated Tg are provided in the Supporting Information. The machine learning models are built with open source python libraries Tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org/) and Scikit-learn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).
